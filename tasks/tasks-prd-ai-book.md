### Notes

- Laravel backend serves as API-only, Vue 3 frontend consumes the API
- Use Laravel Sanctum for SPA authentication with CSRF protection
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind's mobile-first approach
- Use Pinia for Vue 3 state management instead of Vuex
- Background jobs handle email notifications, image processing, and real-time features
- All API endpoints should include proper validation and rate limiting
- Unit and feature tests should cover critical functionality
- Use `php artisan test` for Laravel tests and `npm test` for frontend tests
